An attempt to create a CSP timetable aglorithm to solve
the timetabling program for school and language groups!!!


Proposed Algorithm : Backtracking + Forward Checking

Variables to be set for each class : Hour,Date,Room,Teacher 
multi dimensional solution???? no add more variables

#so the schedule idea is wrong ???


Dont add many constraints it will be too difficult
Constraints:

On weekend morning classes are allowed
Classes must not overlap
Teacher/student  not in different places at the same time
Times a Week,Duration,Days apart
Class A in Building A cannot start immediately after end time of Class B in building B this only applies if TeacherA==TeacherB or studentA==studentB
start 9 in morning end 10 at night
each prof no more than 5 hours straight course
each prof no more than 7 hours a day
students no more than two consecutive classes a day
Teachers cant teach all days
